            <p>MIPS is an assembly language but it correspond to a specific type : the Reduced Instruction Set Computer
                (RISC). This is a type of processor architecture that is characterized by basic instructions (like
                operations, logic AND, etc...) that are easy to decode, consisting only of simple instructions. This
                architecture allows programmers to be more efficient and to develop more easily. A lot of system used
                this architecture like the video games console (PlayStation, Playstation 2, etc ...) or for routers and
                computers too. So it's a really good thing to learn this language because it is used in a lot of system
                and in the future it's possible that you will use it.</p>

            <p>If you want to compile your code on your computer, it will be complicated because a lot of computers
                today is based on x86 (another famous type of assembly language used) and can't compile the MIPS code.
                But a solution exist, it's to find an simulator and good news because a famous simulator exist for MIPS
                called MARS. <a href="http://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/" target="_blank">Click here</a>
                to see the page of it and to download it. MARS will assemble your code and execute it. You just need to
                have Java currently install in your computer and MARS will work.

            <p>What is a register ? It's a memory location internal to a CPU. We can store in these registers simple
                informations like integers, adresses, etc... In the end, it's like variables in other programming
                languages but the difference is the location : variables are not stored in the CPU but in the Random
                Access Memory (RAM). Indeed, the goal of registers is to store these datas temporary to access them
                faster unlike the variables.</p>

            <p>Each register in MIPS begin with the $ character.
                There are 32 registers on MIPS :</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Register 1 - The $zero register always equal to 0, it's used like a constant.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Register 2 - The $at register is reserved by the assembly, you can't use this one.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Registers 3 and 4 - The $v0 and $v1 registers are used to store functions results.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Registers 4 to 7 - The $a0 to $a3 registers are used to store arguments when you need to use a
                    function for exemple.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Registers 8 to 15 - The $t0 to $t7 registers can be used to store any type of informations
                    temporary.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Registers 16 to 23 - The $s0 to $s7 registers are used to save values.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Registers 24 and 25 - The $t8 to $t9 registers are likes the others $t registers before.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Registers 26 and 27 - The $k0 to $k1 registers are reserverd by the kernel system
                    them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Register 28 - The $gp register is the global pointer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Register 29 - The $sp register is the stack pointer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Register 30 - The $fp register is the frame pointer.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Register 31 - The $ra register is the return adress.
                </li>
            </ul>
